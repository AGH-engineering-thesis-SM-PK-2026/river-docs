## Introduction

The RIVER system and its ecosystem was built to be as friendly as possible to the end-user: quick program uploads, remote control, C interoperability ([*]) and simple, yet flexible build tools were designed to make the life easier for everybody, including the system authors. With that being said, the setup and use still demands a lot from the user. There could not be a simple installer for everything - after all the project needs both the hardware platform and the PC to interoperate at all times.

Apart from the practical aspects of getting the system to work, some additional information is provided as a reference for possibly relevant (to the usage or for troubleshooting) parts of the system.

[*]: see limits section for more information.
